## Pydantic Complex Dependencies Management

### Current Issues
1. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Problems with mutual references between classes
   - Issues with initialization order
   - Type hints causing circular imports
   - Self-referential types in nested structures

2. **Initialization Complexities**
   - Required model_rebuild calls
   - Unclear error messages
   - Type mismatches during initialization
   - Service container dependencies resolution

3. **Debugging Difficulties**
   - Hard to track dependency chains
   - Unclear error origins
   - Complex inheritance structures

### Solutions Development Plan

1. **Enhanced Debugging Tools**
   - Improve debug output for complex class structures
   - Add specific debugging for Pydantic model initialization
   - Track dependency chains and initialization order
   - Visualize inheritance and dependency trees
   - Clear error reporting with suggested fixes

2. **Robust Syntax Patterns**
   - Define consistent patterns for:
     - Service containers
     - Multiple inheritance
     - Circular references
     - Type annotations
   - Create documentation and examples
   - Establish best practices

3. **Automated Solutions**
   - Create mixins/base classes for common patterns
   - Implement automatic model_rebuild detection
   - Add dependency resolution helpers
   - Create decorators for common patterns
   - Implement validation hooks

4. **Required Features**
   - Automatic dependency order resolution
   - Clear error messages for circular dependencies
   - Type checking helpers
   - Initialization order management
   - Service container integration

### Implementation Priorities
1. Debug tools for better visibility
2. Base classes and mixins for common patterns
3. Automated dependency resolution
4. Documentation and examples
