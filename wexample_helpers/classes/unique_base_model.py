class UniqueBaseModel(BaseModel):
    """
    Abstract base class that prevents multiple inheritance of BaseModel.

    During the initialization of a subclass, the __init_subclass__ method inspects
    the immediate parent classes to ensure that no more than one class derived from
    BaseModel is present. If multiple BaseModel-derived classes are detected, a
    MultipleBaseModelInheritanceError is raised.

    Why this exists (rationale):
    - Multiple inheritance with several BaseModel-derived parents can lead to
      Method Resolution Order (MRO) ambiguities and subtle bugs in field merging,
      validators, model config and generics (Pydantic v1/v2). These issues are
      often hard to diagnose because they only appear at runtime on specific paths.
    - In team projects, enforcing a single BaseModel ancestor provides a clear rule
      that prevents accidental pattern drift and “magic” behaviour when models
      evolve and mixins get reused.

    Recommended patterns instead of multi-inheritance of BaseModel:
    - Prefer composition or utility mixins that DO NOT inherit from BaseModel.
    - Share validators or constraints via Annotated types / helper functions.
    - Extract common config/logic into standalone helpers or a single shared base.

    This class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly.
